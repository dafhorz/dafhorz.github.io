## Summary
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Googlebot crawls, assessed geo-traffic distribution and conversion rates, and delved into the performance of organic keywords across the top 10 relevant countries. Additionally, I identified and evaluated top-performing pages globally.

## Achievements
**Organic Keyword Performance**
: Examined the top 5,000 organic keywords for each of the top 10 geos (50,000 in total), including associated URLs, offering a detailed understanding of keyword performance in specific regions.

**Conversions and Geo-Traffic Projection**
: Segmented geographical traffic and applied conversion rates to project the potential growth from a traffic optimization strategy, yielding close to a 15% increase in overall conversions.

**Web Crawling Analysis**
:  Conducted an exhaustive examination of Googlebot crawls, allowing to detect landing webpages on an https 400s status and a high number of crawls landing on 304 status; which may be consuming unnecesary crawling budget (up to 60,000 crawls monthly).

# **Important**
**Due to confidenciality of the enterprise and data privacy, this project is not available to download. So I'll limit myself to share very few details.**

## Procedure

### Objective
> you were tasked with conducting a comprehensive analysis covering web crawling behavior, URL performance alignment, and geo-traffic segmentation for conversion optimization. You delved into global performance metrics, identified key pages, assessed the impact of non-Asian countries on conversions, and determined rankings in a specific Asian country. Furthermore, you estimated potential gains through improved click-through rates (CTR) and identified critical keywords, showcasing a strategic understanding of Mixkit's competitive landscape. Overall, the project aimed to provide valuable insights for optimization strategies and enhance the site's competitive positioning.


### Insights
Because my whole insights make reference to topics, keywords, categories, URLs status, statistics and local intel; I can't make this info public.
