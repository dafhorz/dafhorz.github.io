## Description
In this exploration exercise, I analyzed a [dataset] sourced from Dunkin's Marketing Department, comprising 10,000 keywords extracted from SEMrush, overseen by Meagan Voulo. The dataset consists on the following columns:

- Keyword
- Position
- Previous position
- Search Volume
- Keyword Difficulty
- CPC
- URL
- Traffic
- Traffic (%)
- Traffic Cost
- Competition

The whole point of this self research project was to prepare for the Envato-Mixkit project. While the exercise does not yield conclusive findings, it captures my curiosity, willing to learn, prepare and analytical skills.
