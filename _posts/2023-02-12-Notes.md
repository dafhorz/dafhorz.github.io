These are a few notes I did by solving a few exercises, I decided to complement them and save them as some sort of 'cheatsheets'. The notes you'll find [right here] are the following:

  * EDA - A basic EDA exercise which uses an old Kaggle [car dataset]. It explains and follows the 'standard' exploratory process.
  * ETL - The notes focus on how to connect Python to MySQL by using the pymsql module. Also, I briefly explained how I did the cleaning process. I used [aegorenkov]'s 'drinks' dataset.
  * Pandas - This notebook contains Panda's most used commands. At the very beginning it followed the BI lectures (from 365 Careers course), but it got complemented from many other sources. It uses the [absenteeism dataset].
  * Visualization - Basic notes from a Matplot and Seaborn tutorial.
