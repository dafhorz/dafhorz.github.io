### Exploration

Besides the statistics provided by the market researchers at Euromonitor, I requested data to Google Trends to analyze the interest of certain products and services on given time periods. For example, something quiet relevant is the introduction and popularity of *Olipop*: "A new kind of soda that supports digestive health".

  <figcaption>The blue line represents the popularity of Olipop, which gains popularity ot the second half of 2020. Being more popular than 'coke' on 2021.</figcaption>

Also, consumers began to care more about their health, which can be seen by exploring the popularity of the terms 'soda' vs 'coffee' vs 'tea' on search engines.

  <figcaption>The red line starts losing popularity by the end of the first half of 2020. It remains below the other two lines for most of the year and on 2021.</figcaption>
